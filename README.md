# IconWall

IconWall is a Python utility designed to create a visually striking wall of icons that can be used as background images for LinkedIn profiles, websites, wallpapers, or presentation covers. This tool offers customizable settings, including canvas size, perspective transformation, and image spacing, which can be adjusted through a JSON configuration file.

Adaptive Icon Sizing and Even Distribution Based on Number of Icons and Canvas (Output Image) Size

## Features

- Generates a wall of icons on a customizable canvas.
- Applies perspective transformation to create a tilted effect.
- Configurable spacing and padding.
- Supports various image formats.
- Easy configuration through a JSON file.

## Note

This project contains code generated by Gen AI.

Additionally, SVG images are not supported directly. There is no reliable way to convert SVG to PNG without installing
additional software apart from Python packages like CairoSVG.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/psrabhishek/icon-wall.git
   cd icon-wall
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The tool is configured using the `config.json` file located in the root directory of the project. Below is a description
of each field in the configuration file:

| Field                               | Type    | Description                                                                            | Default Value                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `canvas_size`                       | Object  | Defines the dimensions of the canvas.                                                  |                               |
| `canvas_size.height`                | Integer | The height of the canvas in pixels.                                                    | 1920                          |
| `canvas_size.width`                 | Integer | The width of the canvas in pixels.                                                     | 480                           |
| `perspective_transform`             | Object  | Defines the perspective transformation parameters.                                     |                               |
| `perspective_transform.angle`       | Float   | The rotation angle for perspective transformation in degrees.                          | 2.0                           |
| `perspective_transform.skew_factor` | Float   | The skew factor for perspective transformation.                                        | 0.0008                        |
| `min_gap_ratio`                     | Float   | The minimum gap ratio between icons relative to the icon size.                         | 0.20                          |
| `extra_padding_factor`              | Float   | The factor by which to increase the canvas size to add extra padding around the icons. | 1.2                           |
| `input_dir`                         | String  | The directory path where the input images are stored.                                  | "input"                       |
| `output_path`                       | String  | The file path where the final output image will be saved.                              | "output/background_image.png" |
| `image_transparency`                | Integer | The level of transparency for the images (0-255).                                      | 0 (fully transparent)         |

## Running the Tool

1. Ensure you have the input images in the specified input directory (as configured in `config.json`).
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The script will read the configuration from `config.json`, process the images, and save the final output image to the
path specified in the configuration.

## Output files

3 images are generated

1. `image.png` : image of the icon wall
2. `image_extra_pad.png`: same image with added padding on the edge, handy when zoom-out option is not provided by websites
3. `image_perspective.png` : Tilted image to give 3d perspective as if the icons are laid out on a plane

## Example Output

Here is an example of the output image generated by the tool, used as background image in my linked in profile:
